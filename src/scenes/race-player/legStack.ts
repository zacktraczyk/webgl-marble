 *
 * When finish plans are provided, each frame tracks its packed rack exactly:
 * the frame grows or shrinks by the difference between the packed rack
 * height and the saved one, so the rack's bottom wall always sits flush
 * against the next leg's top wall — no dead strip between legs. The leg's
 * authored side walls are trimmed/extended to match in `LegInstance`.
